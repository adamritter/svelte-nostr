- Connect public key API (probably need profile page where it's all easy)
- log queries and look at fresh data
- use relay api
- use multiple relays possibly, see how other clients do it
- separate post query from posts and replies (posts and replies is boring) ??? [seems hard with the current API, need extended API]
- astral looks like a competitor :(
